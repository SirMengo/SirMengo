## Hello! My name is Mengo. 😎

Game development has been my dream and a passion of mine since a young age a. In my github page you will find my school projects and (eventually) my work related to game dev. 🎮

If you found my profile it is because either I made something cool or because you are on the wrong page, either way thank you for stopping by.
