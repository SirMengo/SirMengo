## Hello! My name is Mengo. 😎

I'm a student and aspiring game developer! ✨ 
Game development has been on my dream since a young age and a passion of mine. In my github page you will find my school projects and (eventually) my work related to game dev. 🎮

## More about me:

- 📚 Currently studying @42school
- ⌨️ My main languages of expertise are C and C#
- 🎥 Part-time Twitch streamer and PNGTuber
- 🎨 Trying to learn how to draw and ilustrate

If you found my profile is because either I made something cool or because you are on the wrong page, either way thank you for stopping by.

Feel free to message me incase theres something I can help with! 🙂‍↕️
